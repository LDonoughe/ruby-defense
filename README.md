# Overview:

Ruby Defense is a simple (GPLv3 Licensed) CLI game where you defend a ruby from
attacking elk.



# Requirements:

Configure asdf ruby
`asdf install ruby 2.7.0`

# Setup:
`bundle` (this is short for `bundle install`)

# Tests
running `rspec` or `bundle exec rspec` from the root directory to run the specs

# To Run:
cd /path/to/ruby-defense folder
run `ruby main.rb`

# TODO
[ ] Make a failure screen instead of just throwing an error

[ ] properly increase number of elk per wave as time goes on

[ ] Scoring mechanism/antlers

[ ] (additional) tower purchasing

[ ] [Quality of Life] Cleanup test output since curses mucked that up
